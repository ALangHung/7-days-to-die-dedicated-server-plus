    It‚Äôs recommended to install on a non-system drive (not C:\) and avoid spaces, non-English characters, and non-numeric characters in the path.
   Example: `D:\7DTD-DS-P\`

5. Select the port for the Web Management Interface  
   ![alt text](images/image-4.png)  
   Default: `26901`

   > Tip 1: To allow LAN access to the management panel, open port `26901` in the host machine‚Äôs firewall.  
   > Tip 2: To allow public access, configure port forwarding on your router to forward `26901` to the host machine‚Äôs IP.  
   > Tip 3: !!!!! There is currently no access control. Do not expose the management panel to the public Internet unless you know what you are doing !!!!!

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions

- **Management panel is masked, buttons are unresponsive?**  
  When first opened or if the backend is not connected, the page will be **locked** to prevent accidental operations; it will unlock once the status in the management panel turns green.
- **Installation/Update seems slow?**  
  SteamCMD itself may output logs slowly; if the SteamCMD status in the management panel is green, it means it is still running, please be patient and wait for the completion message.
